## Project Goals

1. Model the Bitcoin blockchain as a dynamic graph; analyze structural properties with **network theory**.
2. Applie **ML and GNNs** to detect signals linked to major crypto events (hacks, regulation).
3. Compare BTC price dynamics to **stochastic models** (Langevin/Blackâ€“Scholes).
4. Implement using best practices in scientific software development (modular code, version control, reproducibility).

## Project Overview

This project combines **graph theory**, **machine learning**, and **statistical physics** to analyze and understand the **dynamics of the Bitcoin blockchain** and its **response to significant events** in the cryptocurrency world.  

By modeling the blockchain as a complex network and studying its evolution, the project aims to uncover patterns that may provide insights into both **structural properties of the BTC graph** and **price dynamics under external shocks**.
