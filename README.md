# BTC Project

## Project Goals

1. **Model the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain as a graph.**
2. **Study the properties of this graph using tools from the Complex Networks course.**
3. **Explore the detection of signals associated with major crypto events (e.g., exchange hacks, political decisions) by analyzing variations in these properties using ML, GNN, etc.**
4. **Compare the evolution of BTC price under the influence of these events to a Blackâ€“Scholes-type model (Langevin equation), applying concepts from the Advanced Statistical Physics course.**

---

This project aims to combine graph theory, machine learning, and statistical physics to analyze and understand the dynamics of the Bitcoin blockchain and its response to significant events in the cryptocurrency world.
