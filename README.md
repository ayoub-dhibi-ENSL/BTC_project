Bitcoin Graph is an ongoing open-source initiative designed to help users analyze and understand the Bitcoin blockchain using graph theory, machine learning, and statistical physics. The project provides tools to model the blockchain as a dynamic graph, detect signals related to major cryptocurrency events, and compare Bitcoin price movements to established stochastic models.

---

### What Does This Project Do?

- **Blockchain Graph Modeling:** Converts Bitcoin blockchain data into a dynamic graph structure, allowing users to visualize and analyze connections between transactions and addresses.
- **Network Analysis:** Applies network theory to study the structural properties of the blockchain graph, such as centrality, clustering, and connectivity.
- **Event Detection:** Uses machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify patterns and signals associated with significant events (e.g., hacks, regulatory changes).
- **Price Dynamics Comparison:** Compares Bitcoin price movements to stochastic models like Langevin/Blackâ€“Scholes, helping users understand market behavior under various conditions.
- **Scientific Software Practices:** Implements modular code, version control, and reproducibility to ensure reliability and ease of collaboration.

### Data Source

The blockchain data used in this project is sourced from [ORBITAAL](https://zenodo.org/records/12581515), which provides comprehensive datasets for Bitcoin transactions and addresses. More details about the methodology used by the authors of the dataset can be found on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.14147v1).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BTC_project.git
    cd BTC_project
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    If you want to replicate my setup, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8+ and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/index.html) 24+ installed. Then, in your BTC_project directory, run:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

3. **Set Up Data:**
    The current version of the project uses the yearly snapshots `orbitaal-snapshot-year.tar.gz` (23.1 GB) from [ORBITAAL](https://zenodo.org/records/12581515). Download and extract the data in the `data/` directory, you should get 13 parquet files under `/data/orbitaal-snapshot-year/SNAPSHOT/EDGES/year/`.

### Timeline

- **Current Step:**  
    Computing graph centralities (= features for GNN)

- **Upcoming Steps:**  
    - Explore the correlations/mutual information between the centralities
    - Use graph embeddings to reduce dimensionnality
    - Build event detection module
    - Integrate price dynamics comparison
    - Build visualization module
    - Finalize documentation and reproducibility features

### Usage

1. **Process the data from data/ and save to CSVs :**
    ```bash
    python3 src/main.py --C year_start year_end
    ```  
    Will process the data for the years betweem (inclusive) `year_start` and `year_end`.
    <br>
2. **Make the plots from the data in the CSVs and saves them in plots/ as PDFs :**
    ```bash
    python3 src/main.py --P year_start year_end
    ```   
    Only if the CSVs exist will make plots for the years betweem (inclusive) `year_start` and `year_end`.  
    <br>
3. **Process the data from data/ and save to CSVs, then make the plots from the data in the CSVs and saves them as PDFs :**
    ```bash
    python3 src/main.py --B year_start year_end
    ```
The `main.py` script includes help message (`-h` or `--help`) for more details.
