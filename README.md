## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

1. **Model the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain as a graph.**
2. **Study the properties of this graph using tools from the Complex Networks course.**
3. **Explore the detection of signals associated with major crypto events**  
   (e.g., exchange hacks, political decisions) by analyzing variations in these properties using ML, GNN, etc.
4. **Compare the evolution of BTC price to a Blackâ€“Scholes-type model**  
   (Langevin equation), applying concepts from the Advanced Statistical Physics course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project combines **graph theory**, **machine learning**, and **statistical physics** to analyze and understand the **dynamics of the Bitcoin blockchain** and its **response to significant events** in the cryptocurrency world.  

By modeling the blockchain as a complex network and studying its evolution, the project aims to uncover patterns that may provide insights into both **structural properties of the BTC graph** and **price dynamics under external shocks**.
